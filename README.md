# Customer_Churn_Project
Customer churn refers to the natural business cycle of losing customers. 

In this project the goal is to use data analytics techniques to help the company in characterizing its customer churn in order to predict which customers would churn in near future. 
Decision tree and Na√Øve Bayes classification algorithms were applied to compare machine learning models with different features.
